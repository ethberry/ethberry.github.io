# Referral program

The referral program rewards users for bringing in new customers. Users refer others to the store, and
upon successful referrals, both the referrer and the new customer receive exclusive benefits. Information about purchase
is being sent to the game server that decides about how to use it.

For example:

- Game server stores total amount spend by referrals and give a cashback of 10%. In this scenario server stores user's
  balance and allows user manually create a claim to redeem it by using [API](/api/game/)
- Game server stores cumulative amount spend by referrals and grants access to uniq items by creating a
  claim itself.

Anyway this mechanics has to be combined with [claim](/market/mechanics-marketing/claim/)
